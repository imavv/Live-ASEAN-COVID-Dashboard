# Live-ASEAN-COVID-Dashboard
A mini project which entails a live dashboard displaying the COVID-19 situation in ASEAN countries, whose data is updated on a daily basis to keep up with the original data source.
 
Data is taken from COVID-19 Data Repository by CSSE at Johns Hopkins University. This data will be preprocessed and exported to a Google Sheet using a Python script, which is automated using a cron job on a daily schedule. Since the sheet is connected to the Tableau dashboard, the updated data would then be reflected in the dashboard.
