# Live-ASEAN-COVID-Dashboard
A mini project which entails a live dashboard displaying the COVID-19 situation in ASEAN countries, whose data is updated on a daily basis to keep up with the original data source.
 
Data is taken from COVID-19 Data Repository by CSSE at Johns Hopkins University. This data will be preprocessed and exported to Google Sheets using a Python script, which is automated using a cron job on a daily schedule.

Final result can be viewed at https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/atmavidya.virananda/viz/ASEANCOVID-19Dashboard/ASEANCOVID-19Dashboard
